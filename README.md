# AntiSpamPro

Antispam plugin with configurable delay, automatic actions (kick, ban) and commands to change settings on the fly in console or in game

/asp - display the current AntiSpamPro settings

/asp kick - kick spammers

/asp ban - ban spammers

/asp banip - banip and ban spammers

/asp bancid - ban, banip and bancid spammers (if available), 
 
asp set {1, 2 or 3} - change the allowed delay between chat to 1, 2 or 3 seconds


You need the permission asp to use any of the commands. There is no spam bypass permission!
The delay setting in config.yml can be set freely, for now.
